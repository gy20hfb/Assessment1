This project consists of a simple agent-based model (ABM).

Information:
This model, in particular, builds agents in space, gets them to interact with one another, reads in environmental data,
allows the agents to interact with the environment, shuffles the order of agent interactions before creating an output
of the data in the form of a scatterplot which will open in a separate window.

Files for model to run:
model9.py
agentframework.py
in.txt

Issues/Errors:
The model would have gone on to be animated and then placed into a GUI and been combined with data from the web.
This code was unable to be initialised correctly but is still hashtagged out at the bottom of the model for reference and to ensure, the rest of the model is clear to read and understand.
